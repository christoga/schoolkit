# Schoolkit
Schoolkit is a web app with 3 features which is :
* Homework Reminder
* Pocket Money
* Notes

## Features
I don't really know how to explain these features, I'll explain it as clear as possible, but I'll recommend you to just try it out yourself.

### Homework Reminder

Homework Reminder is just a simple form submit system, with edit features.

### Pocket Money
Pocket Money is just a simple submit system, so I know how much I have saved, rather than checking my savings and count it one by one.

### Notes
This is the most boring features of this web app, I create it so I doesn't have to scribbling my book everytime the teacher says something irrelevant / sucks / stupid.
